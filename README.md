# AITAI

An easy to use app that allows you to check the positivity or negativity of a message before sending it off to someone else. Based on a machine-learning natural-language-processing model. 


# How to Use

Simply head over to http://saamsa.io:3000 to see the app in action! 

You must create an account first so that your previous messages are stored in our SQL database. Your sensitive information is prehashed before it hits our database!

After signing up or logging in, you can then create new messages, which then be processed through the machine learning model, and an emotional rating will be attached to this message. To view the emotional rating of this message, simply click on the message in the left side, which shows your previous messages.

The longer the sample of text, the more accurate the model is. The score ranges from -1 to 1, -1 being very negative, and 1 being very positive.

You can also edit, delete any of your old messages, by using the corresponding buttons after clicking on a message, as well!
